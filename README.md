# Graduation-Project
Android Mobile Application for supermarket- graduation project(carty)

Abstract

Because people need different household appliances, such as cleaning tools, vegetables and foodstuffs, and the difficulty that some people faced in accessing the large markets in cities away from the countryside and villages, the idea of creating small places came from here that contains the materials that people need on a daily basis, which was recently called it the supermarket. A supermarket is usually located near a residential area to be comfortable for consumers. The problems that this project seeks to solve them each one of us faces it in his/her daily life, for example sometimes we need to buy what we want without any effort or to do purchase operation without being in the supermarket itself, so this project offers a mobile application that will make the life much easier and buy whatever you want with less effort and time, wither you want to use it at home or at the supermarket you will notice the difference and how much itâ€™s good for use. Another problem we face that sometimes we buy a product with high price where some supermarkets offers the same product with less price so our application will give the ability for the customer to see all the offers and discounts on the products, so s/he will save money by using these offers, also the owner will increase the sales and the profits so in this way both customer and owner benefit. Also this application will serve the customer by give him/her the ability to save the favorite products in the cart and s/he can add or remove to it any time, and this application will help the user by sending notifications of the products that the system predict that the customer may need depending on him/her purchasing habits On the other hand,  the application also serves the owner by give him/her the ability to make sales on the products, also s/he can a see the customers orders from the system, to take reach the order to the customer and then the owner/admin can delete the order after reaching it to the customer successfully.
